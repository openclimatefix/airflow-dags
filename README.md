> [!Note]
> This repo is a migration of the `dags` folder from the

Many of OCF's production services run as batch pipelines managed by an Airflow deployment.
This repo defines those airflow DAGs that configure, version control, and test these pipelines,
and handles the deployment process.

## Releases

### 1.5.0 - 2025-06-02

## How to make a release to production

Releases to development are made automatically when a PR is merged to `main`. 
For production releases, we try to bundle a few changes together in a minor version release. 
Once we are ready to release to production we follow the next steps

- Create a new branch called `X.Y-release`
- Update the readme, with the changes made in this new release. This can be done by compare tags, for [example](https://github.com/openclimatefix/airflow-dags/compare/v1.2.0...v1.2.7). 
- Create a PR from `X.Y-release` to `main` and get this approved.
- When merging this PR, add `#minor` to the PR `Extended description` under `Commit message`. 
- Merge the PR to `main` and delete the branch, this will create the tag `X.Y`. 
- Under Actions, go to `Deploy DAGs`, click on `Run workflow` and select the `X.Y` tag. This will then need to be approved. 

## Installation

Copy the `airflow_dags` folder into your `dags` location:
```bash
$ cp -r airflow_dags /path/to/airflow/dags
```

Or use the build webserver image in your containerized airflow deployment:
```bash
$ docker pull ghcr.io/openclimatefix/airflow-dags
```

## Example usage

See the docker-compose file in the
[ocf-infrastructure](https://github.com/openclimatefix/ocf-infrastructure)
repository. 

## Documentation

DAGs are defined in the `dags` folder, split into modules according to domain.
Each domain corresponds to a seperate deployment of airflow, and as such,
a distinct set of DAGs, hence some similarity or even duplication is expected. 

Functions, or custom operators, are found in the `plugins` folder.

## FAQ

### Can I change the name of a DAG?

Try to avoid it! The DAG name is how airflow identifies the DAG in the database.
If you change the name of a DAG, airflow will treat it as a new DAG.
This means that the old DAG will still be in the database, but it will not be updated or run. 

### Why move this here from ocf-infrastructure?

Because service running configuration isn't terraform configuration!
Terraform is usually used for setting up infrastructure - platform level resources like databases, networks, and VMs, and, Airflow itself.
The DAGs that airflow runs, and the versions of the services that those DAGs run, are implementation details,
and so should be stored in the config-as-code repository for airflow.

Furthermore, as a mostly Python organisation, having a top-level python only repo for Airflow increases it's accessibility to the wider team.  

## Development

### Linting and static type checking
 
This project uses [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for static type checking
and [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting.
Installing the development dependencies makes them available in your virtual environment.

Use them via:

```bash
$ python -m mypy .
$ python -m ruff check .
```

Be sure to do this periodically while developing to catch any errors early
and prevent headaches with the CI pipeline. It may seem like a hassle at first,
but it prevents accidental creation of a whole suite of bugs.

### Running the test suite

There are some additional dependencies to be installed for running the tests,
be sure to pass `--extra=dev` to the `pip install -e .` command when creating your virtualenv.
(Or use uv and let it do it for you!)

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
$ python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
```
